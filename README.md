# **Abstract:**
 In quantitative trading, stock prediction plays an important role in developing an effective trading strategy to achieve a substantial return. Also the prediction outcomes are the prerequisites for active portfolio construction and optimization. However, the stock prediction is a challenging task because of the diversified factors involved such as uncertainty and instability, sentiments of the traders and investors etc. Hence prediction of the stock prices are important to enter into the trade for which one of the most important part is extracting relevant features which can be used for forecasting. 
 
 In this project, we will be extracting various nancial features from the raw downloaded stocks data such as **Bollinger Bands**, **Rate-of-change (ROC)**,**Average Directional Index (ADX)**, **William's % R**, **Stochastic %K** and many others. After extracting various financial features we will move on to the prediction part in which we will be using Machine Learning models such as  **Linear regression**, **Random Forrest**, **XgBoost** and do a comparative study.
